* Introduction

  An elf that connect browsers and executables.

  Chelf is a command line program, hosting as an http server.

  Chelf provide http interfaces to spawn and manage executables in the host.

  Now, you're being able to launch applications from bookmarks in your browser,
  with the help of chelf.

  Just simply add the program you want to spawn in the url specified below,
  one click and have your application started.

  Enjoy :P

* The story

  While I'm playing around with my chromebook, I installed linux applicaitons
  in chroot with the help of Crouton. It is good, but not good enough. I really
  want to pin my linux application on the shelf of ChromeOS, so that I don't have
  to type so many commands, only to start a application, every time. It is really
  annoying, and this is the thing I finally come up with.

  Oh!! It feels so good to be able to pin applications on bookmarks.
